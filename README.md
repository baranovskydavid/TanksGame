The objectives of the project were:
1. Learn to work with Zenject framework and create project architecture
2. Experiment in layout and create UI interface (Scene Authorization)
3. Create a controller for a tank with realistic tracks

The project implemented:
1. 3 game states: Authorization, Hangar, Battlefield.
2. The Authorization state implemented ui for login\registration\restore password, as well as offline game
3. In Hangar, the player is shown all the tanks he has (2 similar for previews), he can select a tank and enter the battle(scene battlefield)
4. The game has a pause menu and settings in which you can adjust the graphics and control, as well as go back to Authorization
5. On the Battlefield stage, the playerâ€™s tank is spawned, on the tank are implemented the mechanics of riding, bending, realistic tracks, turning the turret and barrel behind the mouse pointer.

Also, the peculiarity of this project is that when working on it, I had absolutely no Internet, so I had to use the already accumulated knowledge and offline documentation Unity.

To launch the project:  1. You need to download package 2. Import it into the empty unity 3 project. Add all the scenes (main, authorization, hangar, battlefield) to Scenes in Build 4. Start the Main scene
